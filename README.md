# My Very First Web Page

Welcome:

This project was created for my CodeInstitute Full Stack Programming course.  I utilized GitPod to write and preview my work.

GitPod provides virtual servers with a built in Microsoft Visual Studio Code based front end for viewing and editing code.  It also provides terminal access to the virtual server for viewing the filesystem and running programs. I utilized this feature to set up and use my GitHub repositories.

In order to create the website, I utilized HTML and CSS code languages to generate and style the content, respectively.
